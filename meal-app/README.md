### Technologies

Technologies: 
- Used Ajax to get data from api. 
- jQuery to export data to webpage. 
- The complex interface I chose was tooltips to show the title of the meals

##Approach

Approach:
-The approach I took was quite simple. Once I figured out how to receive the data from the meal db, I decided instead of showing the meals name I wanted to show the image of the meal and have the user interact with it. Instead of showing the instructions right away, I decided to toggle that on and off when the user clicks on the image. 

##Difficulties

Some of the difficulties I ran into was trying to doing the tooltip. For the images it was simple because all they need is the title name, but for the images that are inputs was the hard part. Another thing I was into was trying to get the ingredients and the measurements. Since they were both different properties I tried putting the two in a 2d array, and I went down this rabbit hole, so I decided due to time constraints that I should try to implement once I get the MVP.
