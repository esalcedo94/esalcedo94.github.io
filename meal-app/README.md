### Technologies

Technologies: 
- Used Ajax to get data from api. 
- jQuery to export data to webpage. 
- The complex interface I chose was tooltips to show the title of the meals

##Approach

Approach:
-The approach I took was quite simple. Once I figured out how to recieve the data from the meal db, I decided instead of showing the meals name I wanted to show the image of the meal and have the user interact with it. Instead of showing the instructions right away, I decided to toggle that on and off when the user clicks on the image.
